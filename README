LocOO3D is a software tool for locating seismic events.

LocOO3D is delivered with the following components:

- A license agreement.

- LocOO3D_Users_Manual.pdf.

- Source code

- A pom.xml file which can be used with Maven (https://maven.apache.org) 
  to rebuild the jar file from the source code.

- A precompiled jar file: target/locoo3d-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar. 
  This jar file can be run as a a standalone application or can be used as a 
  library in user-developed java applications.  The jar was compiled with 
  java JDK version 10.

- Run-script locoo3d.sh.  User's will likely have to edit some paths defined
  in the run script to point to correct locations on their systems.

- Run-script support map.sh.  User's will likely have to edit some paths defined
  in the run script to point to correct locations on their systems.  See
  LocOO3D_Users_Manual.pdf for more information about SupporMap.
  

Oracle Libraries

LocOO3D depends on Oracle ojdbc<version>.jar.  This library is not delivered
with LocOO3D. Users will need to find the required jar file on their system 
and specify its location in the locoo3d.sh run-script and/or maven pom.xml file.  
LocOO3D was tested successfully with ojbdc7 and ojbdc8.  Other versions
may work as well.

RSTT/SLBM

LocOO3D can compute predictions using RSTT/SLBM but the C++ SLBM libraries must
be downloaded and installed.  To install SLBM, download the source code from
https://www.sandia.gov/rstt/software/downloads. Unzip the download file and 
cd into the unzipped rstt directory.  Type 'make' to build the SLBM 
libraries.  Edit run-script locoo3d.sh and specify the path to the rstt
directory.
