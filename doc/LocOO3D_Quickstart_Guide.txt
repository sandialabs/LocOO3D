INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING MODELS AND SOFTWARE TO RUN THE EXAMPLES PROVIDED


INSTALL LOCOO3D:

1. Clone the LocOO3D software package from https://github.com/sandialabs/LocOO3D
	If you do not have git installed on your computer, install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads
	If you do not have a github directory on your computer, create one, e.g., /Users/$USER/github.
	 
	From a terminal window, cd into the github directory and execute:
		git clone git@github.com:sandialabs/LocOO3D.git
	This will download the contents of the LocOO3D repository, including the software and example files.

2. Update the configure.sh file:
	a. Set locoo3d_jar to the full path of the locoo3d*.jar file in the target/ directory.
	b. On your system find the Oracle ojdbc*.jar file. This jar file is not included with LocOO3D.
	   Set OJDBC to the path to your ojdbc*.jar file to use LocOO3D with an Oracle database.
	c. Set RSTT to the path to the RSTT library to use LocOO3D with RSTT/SLBM 
		(see www.sandia.gov/rstt for details)

3. Run configure.sh to create an executable 'locoo3d' file. The configure.sh script will generate a 'set path' 
	or 'export' command which should be copied to your .cshrc or .bash_profile file. 
	Source your .bash_profile or .cshrc file. 



CREATE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

4. Create a working directory on your system for running examples (e.g. snl_location_software).

5. Copy the "Examples" directory to this working directory and uncompress Examples_libcorr3d.tgz

2. Download the following model files into the working directory and uncompress them:
	a. SALSA3D - From www.sandia.gov/salsa3d/velocity-models.html:  SALSA3D_Model.tgz
	b. RSTT - From www.sandia.gov/rstt:  pdu202009Du.zip


8. When complete, the user should have the following directory structure set up:

SET UP SUPPORT MAP:

For background information about support maps, see Appendix D of the LocOO3D Users.

9. cd to the working directory Examples directory and run:
	supportmap supportMap.properties


RUN EXAMPLES:

10. Examples can be run by navigating into the Examples/ExampleXX directories and running

	locoo3d example*.properties

Note that Example05 requires access to an Oracle database with CSS3.0-formatted tables of seismic data. If database tables 
for the International Data Center (IDC) Reviewed Event Bulletin (REB) are accessible, then Example05 runs the exact same 
problem as Example01. Users will need to edit file example05.properties and specify correct database connection parameters.
